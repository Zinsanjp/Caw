## 🚀 Overview

CAW Protocol is a decentralized social network built on blockchain technology. All actions are cryptographically signed and verified on-chain, ensuring censorship-resistant content and permissionless participation.

### Key Features
- 🔐 **Trustless** - All actions are EIP-712 signed and verified on-chain
- 🌍 **Decentralized** - Permissionless validator network processes actions
- 🛡️ **Censorship-Resistant** - Content stored on blockchain cannot be removed
- 🔗 **Multi-Chain** - Ethereum L1, Base L2, with Arbitrum archive chain
- ⚡ **Cross-Chain Archiving** - LayerZero-based replication to archive chains

## ⚡ Run a node in one command

On a fresh Debian/Ubuntu host:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GilgameshCaw/Caw/master/install.sh)"
```

The installer asks for your domain, picks up sudo, installs every system dep (Node 22, pm2, nginx, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, certbot), then hands you to an interactive CLI that walks through node type, RPC URLs, validator config, and TLS. **You do not need to clone anything or follow the manual steps below first.**

Full options, requirements, and env-var overrides are in [Run a Node](#-run-a-node-1) further down.

## 🛠 Run a Node

There are two ways to run a CAW node: the **one-liner installer** (recommended for fresh Linux servers — VPS, cloud, etc.) and the **manual install** (if you want full control or you're on macOS for local dev).

### One-liner installer

On a fresh Debian/Ubuntu host:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GilgameshCaw/Caw/master/install.sh)"
```

The script:

- Asks for your domain, then re-execs with sudo
- Detects host capacity (RAM / cores / disk) and warns if you're below recommended specs
- Asks how you want to run Postgres / Redis / Elasticsearch (native install, Docker, or connect to existing)
- Installs Node 22, pm2, yarn, nginx, ufw, certbot, and the chosen DB stack
- Creates a `caw` system user, clones the repo to `/var/www/<domain>`, hands off to the interactive Node CLI
- The CLI walks you through node type, network, RPC URLs, validator config, optional replication, infrastructure, and TLS

#### Requirements

| Resource | Minimum (validator-only) | Recommended (full node) |
|---|---|---|
| **RAM** | 2 GB | 8 GB |
| **CPU** | 1 core | 2+ cores |
| **Disk** | 10 GB | 25+ GB SSD |
| **OS** | Linux (apt-based) | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS |
| **Network** | Public IPv4 | Static IPv4 + domain |

A full node runs Elasticsearch (~512 MB heap), Postgres, Redis, the Node API + indexers under pm2, and an nginx-served React build. ES is the dominant memory consumer.

#### Environment overrides

Set these before running the script to skip the corresponding prompt:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CAW_DIR` | Install directory (default: `/var/www/<domain>` from the prompt) |
| `CAW_REPO` | Git remote (default: `https://github.com/GilgameshCaw/Caw.git`) |
| `CAW_BRANCH` | Branch to check out (default: `master`) |
| `CAW_USER` | System user that owns the install (default: `caw`) |
| `CAW_DOMAIN` | Skip the domain prompt |
| `CAW_INFRA_MODE` | `native`, `docker`, or `existing` |
| `CAW_DB_URL` / `CAW_REDIS_URL` / `CAW_ES_URL` | Use these instead of installing the corresponding service |
| `CAW_CERT_PATH` / `CAW_KEY_PATH` | Skip the TLS prompt; use these files for nginx |
| `CAW_API_PORT` | Override the default API port (4000) |
| `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1` | Skip apt installs (assume system deps are already there) |

### Manual install

If the one-liner doesn't fit your environment, install the system deps yourself, then run the interactive CLI:

```bash
# 1. System packages (Debian/Ubuntu shown — adapt for your distro)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl git build-essential nginx postgresql postgresql-contrib redis-server

# Node 22 from NodeSource
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g yarn pm2

# Elasticsearch from Elastic's apt repo (or use a managed ES instance)
curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y elasticsearch

# 2. Configure Elasticsearch (cap heap, disable auth, bind localhost)
# See install.sh for the exact /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml we write.

# 3. Create a non-root user and clone the repo
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" caw
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/<your-domain>
sudo chown caw:caw /var/www/<your-domain>
sudo -u caw git clone https://github.com/GilgameshCaw/Caw.git /var/www/<your-domain>

# 4. Run the interactive CLI as the caw user
cd /var/www/<your-domain>
sudo -u caw bash -c 'cd cli && npm install'
sudo -u caw node cli/bin/caw.js install --dir /var/www/<your-domain>
```

The CLI generates `client/.env`, `client/config.json`, and `ecosystem.config.cjs`, runs `prisma db push`, and starts services under pm2.

### Local dev (macOS)

For local development without Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GilgameshCaw/Caw.git
cd Caw

# Install Node 22, postgres, redis, elasticsearch via Homebrew
brew install node@22 postgresql@16 redis elasticsearch

# Start the stateful services
brew services start postgresql@16
brew services start redis
brew services start elasticsearch

# Run the interactive CLI
cd cli && npm install && cd ..
node cli/bin/caw.js install --dir "$PWD"
```

Pick the `dev` deployment mode in the CLI — vite serves the frontend live at http://localhost:5274 and pm2 watches the API.

## 🧰 Developer scripts (already-installed checkout)

> Not a setup path. If you just want to run a node, use the [one-liner installer](#-run-a-node-in-one-command) above. The commands below are for working *inside* a checkout the installer (or `cli/bin/caw.js install`) has already configured.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v22.0.0+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GilgameshCaw/Caw.git
cd Caw

# Install dependencies
cd client
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Set up database
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start development environment
cd ..
npm run dev
```

This starts all services:
- Frontend at http://localhost:5173
- API at http://localhost:4000
- Validator, event processors, and background services

### Available Scripts (root)
```bash
npm run dev    # Start all services (Redis, API with hot reload, frontend)
npm start      # Start Redis and API services
npm run web    # Start frontend only
npm test       # Run TypeScript check and Mocha tests
```

### Frontend (client/src/services/FrontEnd/)
```bash
yarn dev       # Start Vite dev server
yarn build     # TypeScript compile and production build
yarn lint      # Run ESLint
```

### Smart Contracts (solidity/)
```bash
npx truffle compile                     # Compile contracts
npx truffle migrate --network dev       # Deploy locally
npx truffle migrate --network testnetL2 # Deploy to Base Sepolia
npx truffle test                        # Run contract tests
```

## 🔄 Architecture

```
Users -> Frontend -> API -> Database <- Validator -> Blockchain (L2)
                              |                         |
                       ActionProcessor <- RawEventsGatherer
                                                        |
                                              Validator (optimistic replication)
                                                        |
                                              CawActionsArchive (Archive Chain)
                                                        ▲
                                                        │ LayerZero (challenges)
                                                        │
                                              CawChallengeRelay
```

**Key Components:**
- **Frontend** - React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS + Wagmi/RainbowKit
- **API** - Express server receiving EIP-712 signed actions
- **Validator** - Batches and submits pending actions on-chain; optionally stakes ETH on `CawActionsArchive` and submits checkpoint replications optimistically
- **Blockchain** - Immutable source of truth (Base L2)
- **Event Processors** - Index blockchain events into PostgreSQL
- **Archive + Challenge Relay** - Optimistic archive with 2-day fraud-proof window; challenge-relay ships canonical checkpoint hashes from the source L2 to the archive over LayerZero

## 📈 Observability

Two optional integrations, both gated by env vars and no-op when unset. The CLI install asks for both.

### Sentry — error reporting

Set `SENTRY_DSN` (backend) and/or `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (frontend) to forward uncaught exceptions to Sentry. The CLI prompts for one DSN that's used for both, since Sentry routes by source.

### SigNoz — performance tracing

Self-hosted [SigNoz](https://signoz.io) gives you traces for every HTTP route, Prisma query, Redis call, and outbound RPC — useful for finding slow endpoints and seeing where time is spent inside a request.

The CLI walks you through it during install. You'll get three options:

- **Use SigNoz on this box** — auto-detects whether SigNoz is already running on `:4318`. If yes, just points at it; if no, the CLI clones SigNoz into `~/.caw-signoz/` and runs `docker compose up -d` for you (~4GB RAM, ~30GB disk). On apt-based hosts (Debian / Ubuntu) the CLI will offer to install Docker first if it's missing. Multiple CAW nodes on one host share the same install.
- **Use SigNoz on a different box** — paste the URL (e.g. `http://signoz.internal:4318`).
- **Skip** — no tracing; the SDK is a no-op.

`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` is auto-derived from your domain (falling back to `caw-client-{id}`) so multiple instances sharing one collector show up as distinct services in the UI.

The endpoint is the standard [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/) base URL — anything OTLP-compatible (Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, etc.) works as a drop-in replacement.
