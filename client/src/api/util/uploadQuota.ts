// Per-token daily upload quota, scoped by upload kind. Counts cumulative
// bytes uploaded per tokenId per rolling 24h window. Posts and DMs are
// SEPARATE budgets — a heavy DM user can't starve their post quota and
// vice versa. DMs have a much tighter cap because they reach 1 person
// (1:1 channel) vs posts reaching the world; per-byte storage cost is
// the same, but the value-per-byte is wildly different.
//
// Why per-token (not per-IP / per-address): tokens map cleanly to users
// in this app, the auth layer already validates token ownership before
// reaching upload routes, and per-IP doesn't work behind shared NAT.
//
// Why bytes (not request count): a 10MB video and a 100KB image have
// wildly different storage cost. Counting bytes is the right unit.
//
// Storage shape mirrors session_ratelimit (Redis list of timestamp:size
// entries) because (a) it's the established pattern in this codebase,
// (b) it survives restarts, (c) checking the running total is O(N) over
// today's entries which stays small at sane caps.
