// Orphan media GC. Tracks media files that are no longer referenced
// (post hidden, avatar replaced, etc.) and deletes them from Filebase
// after a 7-day grace period.
//
// Why a 7-day grace:
//   - Hide is permanent (recorded on-chain, can't be undone — see the
//     hide-confirmation copy in FeedItem.tsx), so revertibility isn't
//     the concern. The grace is for indexer lag and in-flight clients.
//   - Indexer lag: a hide action might race with someone else loading
//     the post. Keeping the file briefly avoids 404s in that window.
//   - Cheap insurance — Filebase storage is metered but not expensive,
//     and a recoverable mistake beats an unrecoverable one.
//
// Design (option B from the planning conversation):
//   - Redis sorted set keyed by delete-after-timestamp
//     ZADD orphan_media <delete_at_ms> <bucket_key>
//   - Sweep job polls ZRANGEBYSCORE 0 <now>, deletes the keys from
//     Filebase, then ZREM-s them from the set.
//   - No DB schema change — keeps the testnet-friendly approach the user
//     asked for. If we ever need an audit trail, swap in a MediaAsset
//     table; the API of this module stays identical.
//
// We track BUCKET KEYS (the Filebase path), not URLs. Parsing the URL
// to a key happens on the way in. Keys are stable; URLs depend on the
// MEDIA_PUBLIC_URL_BASE config which can change.
