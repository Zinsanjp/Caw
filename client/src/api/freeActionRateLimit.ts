// Per-senderId rate limit on free actions (unlike, unfollow). These cost
// 0 CAW so an attacker could spam them to grief the validator's gas
// budget. Backed by Redis instead of an in-memory Map so the limit is
// shared across worker processes — the in-memory version was bypassable
// by spreading requests across workers (effective limit = N×30/min for
// N workers).
