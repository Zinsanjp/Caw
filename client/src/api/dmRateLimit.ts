// src/api/dmRateLimit.ts
//
// Per-(senderId, recipientId) DM rate limiter, backed by Redis. The
// receiver-side coarse limit (per-source-IP, mounted in server.ts at
// /api/dm/relay) catches a misbehaving peer hammering us; this is the
// fine-grained per-user-pair limit applied on the SENDER's side, where
// the home node knows the user's session and can apply consent
// baseline. The receiver trusts that the source enforced this — a
// source that lies costs them their relay reputation, future work.
//
// Caps:
//   - cold (recipient has no consent baseline for sender): 10/h
//   - warm (recipient has DM'd back, or there's a follow either way): 100/h
//
// "Warm" reduces to "any prior message from recipient → sender", "sender
// follows recipient", or "recipient follows sender". These are the same
// signals the request-inbox gate uses, so the labels stay consistent.

// Inbound relay cap, per PROJECT_BACKLOG.md's DDoS protection section:
// "a peer hammering relayDmToPeers with spoofed identities can fill the
// DB." checkDmRate() above is sender-side and does warm/cold DB lookups
// (message/follow queries) — fine for a user hitting send, but wrong for
// the receiver side of /api/dm/relay: those lookups would themselves
// become a new load vector under a relay flood. This is deliberately
// dumber: one Redis INCR per (recipientId), no DB reads, no warm/cold
// distinction. It doesn't tell apart "one attacker" from "many senders
// legitimately messaging the same popular account" — same tradeoff the
// per-source-IP cap already makes, just on the other axis.
//
// 500/h, not 200/h as I first had it: sender-side warm senders alone can
// do 100/h each (WARM_LIMIT_PER_HOUR above), so a cap much lower than a
// small multiple of that would throttle a popular account getting
// legitimate messages from just a handful of warm contacts. 500 leaves
// headroom for that, in the loose sense — still not validated against
// real usage, just checked against the other limiter so they're not
// flatly contradictory.
//
// Correction: "room for ~5 concurrent warm senders" overstated the
// precision of that comparison.
// KEY_WARM is scoped per-(senderId, recipientId) and only enforced by
// the sender's home node; KEY_INBOUND_RELAY is scoped per-recipientId
// and aggregates across every source instance relaying to them. Warm
// senders on other instances aren't counted against this node's
// WARM_LIMIT_PER_HOUR at all, so "5 senders at 100/h each" isn't a real
// derivation of 500 — just a rough sanity check that 500 isn't obviously
// too low relative to the other number in this file.
